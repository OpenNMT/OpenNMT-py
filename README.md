# OpenNMT-py: Open-Source Neural Machine Translation

This is a [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
port of [OpenNMT](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT),
an open-source (MIT) neural machine translation system. It is designed to be research friendly to try out new ideas in translation, summary, image-to-text, morphology, and many other domains.


OpenNMT-py is run as a collaborative open-source project. It is currently maintained by [Sasha Rush](http://github.com/srush) (Cambridge, MA), [Ben Peters](http://github.com/bpopeters) (Saarbr√ºcken), and [Jianyu Zhan](http://github.com/jianyuzhan) (Shenzhen). The original code was written by [Adam Lerer](http://github.com/adamlerer) (NYC). Codebase is nearing a stable 0.1 version. We currently recommend forking if you want stable code.

We love contributions. Please consult the Issues page for any [Contributions Welcome](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22) tagged post.

## Quickstart

[Full Documentation](http://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/)


### Step 1: Preprocess the data

```bash
python preprocess.py -train_src data/src-train.txt -train_tgt data/tgt-train.txt -valid_src data/src-val.txt -valid_tgt data/tgt-val.txt -save_data data/demo
```

We will be working with some example data in `data/` folder.

The data consists of parallel source (`src`) and target (`tgt`) data containing one sentence per line with tokens separated by a space:

* `src-train.txt`
* `tgt-train.txt`
* `src-val.txt`
* `tgt-val.txt`

Validation files are required and used to evaluate the convergence of the training. It usually contains no more than 5000 sentences.


After running the preprocessing, the following files are generated:

* `demo.train.pt`: serialized PyTorch file containing training data
* `demo.valid.pt`: serialized PyTorch file containing validation data
* `demo.vocab.pt`: serialized PyTorch file containing vocabulary data


Internally the system never touches the words themselves, but uses these indices.

### Step 2: Train the model

```bash
python train.py -data data/demo -save_model demo-model
```

The main train command is quite simple. Minimally it takes a data file
and a save file.  This will run the default model, which consists of a
2-layer LSTM with 500 hidden units on both the encoder/decoder. You
can also add `-gpuid 1` to use (say) GPU 1.

### Step 3: Translate

```bash
python translate.py -model demo-model_epochX_PPL.pt -src data/src-test.txt -output pred.txt -replace_unk -verbose
```

Now you have a model which you can use to predict on new data. We do this by running beam search. This will output predictions into `pred.txt`.

!!! note "Note"
    The predictions are going to be quite terrible, as the demo dataset is small. Try running on some larger datasets! For example you can download millions of parallel sentences for [translation](http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/translation-task.html) or [summarization](https://github.com/harvardnlp/sent-summary).

## Pretrained embeddings (e.g. GloVe)

Go to tutorial: [How to use GloVe pre-trained embeddings in OpenNMT-py](http://forum.opennmt.net/t/how-to-use-glove-pre-trained-embeddings-in-opennmt-py/1011)

## Pretrained Models

The following pretrained models can be downloaded and used with translate.py (These were trained with an older version of the code; they will be updated soon).

- [onmt_model_en_de_200k](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6N7tANPyVeBWE9WazRYaUd2QTg/view?usp=sharing): An English-German translation model based on the 200k sentence dataset at [OpenNMT/IntegrationTesting](https://github.com/OpenNMT/IntegrationTesting/tree/master/data). Perplexity: 20.
- onmt_model_en_fr_b1M (coming soon): An English-French model trained on benchmark-1M. Perplexity: 4.85.
