OpenNMT-py is the [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) version of the [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net) project, an open-source (MIT) neural machine translation (and beyond!) framework. It is designed to be research friendly to try out new ideas in translation, language modeling, summarization, and many other NLP tasks. Some companies have proven the code to be production ready.

We love contributions! Please look at issues marked with the [contributions welcome](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributions+welcome%22) tag.

Before raising an issue, make sure you read the requirements and the [Full Documentation](https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/) examples.

Unless there is a bug, please use the [Forum](https://forum.opennmt.net) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py) to ask questions.

## For beginners:

There is a new step-by-step and explained tuto (Thanks to Yasmin Moslem): [Tutorial](https://github.com/ymoslem/OpenNMT-Tutorial)

Please try to read and/or follow before raising newbies issues.

Otherwise you can just have a look at the [Quickstart](https://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/quickstart.html) steps

If you used previous versions of OpenNMT-py, you can check the [Changelog](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) or the [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py/blob/master/docs/source/changes.md)

## Setup

OpenNMT-py requires:

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.13 <2

Install `OpenNMT-py` from `pip`:
```bash
pip install OpenNMT-py
```

or from the sources:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py.git
cd OpenNMT-py
pip install -e .
```

Note: if you encounter a `MemoryError` during installation, try to use `pip` with `--no-cache-dir`.

*(Optional)* Some advanced features (e.g. working pretrained models or specific transforms) require extra packages, you can install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.opt.txt
```
