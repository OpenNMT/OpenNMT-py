Mars has an atmosphere that is almost entirely carbon dioxide.Why isn't there a strong greenhouse effect keeping the planet warm?,Mars does not have enough internal heat to drive the greenhouse effect,Mars is too far from the sun for the greenhouse effect to work,the greenhouse effect requires an ozone layer which Mars does not have,the atmosphere on Mars is too thin to trap a significant amount of heat,D
You've made a scientific theory that there is a force between all objects. This forcce has both a dark and light side. When will your theory be proven correct?,When you and many other Jedi have tested the hypothesis,Jean-Luc Skywalker drops Yoda during the day and he falls to the ground proving your theory.,"You can never prove your theory to be correct only ""yet to be proven wrong.""",After you've repeated your experiment many times,C
Why do Uranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds but Jupiter and Saturn do not?,Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.,Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.,The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.,Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.,A
All of the following have been cited as evidence for the Giant Impact Hypothesis except:,The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moon.,Most rocks on the Moon’s surface are older than those on the Earth’s surface.,The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size.,The Moon was once entirely molten.,B
Why do scientists think Mars was once warmer and wetter?,Mars shows evidence of significant volcanism which implies that the climate was once warmer and therefore wetter,early observations showed what appeared to be changing vegetation patterns and canals indicating the presence of water,there are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface,all planets tend to begin with warm wet climates and gradually become cold and dry with smaller planets cooling faster than larger planets,C
How do astronomers think Jupiter generates its internal heat?,nuclear fusion in the core,by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy,internal friction due to its high rotation rate,chemical processes,B
Which one of these constellations is not located along the Milky Way in the sky?,Perseus,Cygnus,Scorpius,Leo,D

Approximately how long does it take Pluto to orbit the Sun once?,150 years,200 years,250 years,300 years,C
Mars might be a place for future human explorations. However humans can not breathe on the surface of Mars because the atmosphere consists mostly of ...,Nitrogen,Argon,Methane,CO2,D
Which of the jovian planets have rings?,Neptune,Uranus,Saturn,all of the above,D
Besides large astronomical objects astrophysicists are also interested in small particles from space. Which one of these particles has the weakest interactions with other particles?,µ Muons,Antiparticles,ν Neutrinos,π Pions,C
Approximately how old is the surface of Venus?,750 million years.,2 billion years.,3 billion years.,4.5 billion years.,A
"Why do jovian planets bulge around the equator that is have a ""squashed"" appearance?",Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more.,They are much more massive than the terrestrial planets.,Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.,Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets.,C
How do astronomers think Jupiter generates its internal heat?,through exothermic chemical reactions converting chemical potential energy into thermal energy,nuclear fusion,by contracting changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy,internal friction due to its rapid rotation rate and differential rotation,C
What defines the habitable zone around a star?,the region around a star where liquid water can potentially exist on planetary surfaces,the region around a star where humans can survive,the region around a star where the ultraviolet radiation does not destroy organisms on a planetary surface,the region around a star where life exists,A
Why are Cepheid stars relevant for astronomers?,To measure interstellar mass.,To measure galactic distances.,To measure galactic energy-density.,To measure interstellar density.,B
What is the so-called bolometric luminosity in astronomy?,The luminosity integrated over vertically polarized wavelengths.,The luminosity integrated over horizontally wavelengths.,The luminosity integrated over visible wavelengths.,The luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.,D
Radio telescopes are crucial for astronomical observations. Which one of these well-known radio telescopes has the largest parabolic antenna?,Green Bank Telescope,Arecibo Telescope,Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope,Effelsberg Telescope,B
