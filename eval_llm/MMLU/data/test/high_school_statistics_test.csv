"Consider the two sets X = {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90} and Y = {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}. Which of the following is false?",The sets have identical medians.,The sets have identical means.,The sets have identical ranges.,None of the above are false.,D
Which of the following is a true statement?,"In a well-designed, well-conducted sample survey, sampling error is effectively eliminated.","In a well-designed observational study, responses are influenced through an orderly, carefully planned procedure during the collection of data.","In a well-designed experiment, the treatments are carefully planned to result in responses that are as similar as possible.",None of the above is a true statement.,D
"A researcher is hoping to find a predictive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables in her study. Accordingly, as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables. The interval is determined to be (0.45, 0.80). Which of the following is (are) true? (Assume conditions for inference are met.) I. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. II. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables. III. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.",I and II only,I and III only,II and III only,I only,A
A student organization at a university is interested in estimating the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly. How many students should be sampled to get a 90 percent confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08?,27,64,106,423,D
A correlation of 0.6 indicates that the percentage of variation in y that is explained by the variation in x is how many times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3?,2,3,4,6,C
For which of the following is it appropriate to use a census?,A 95% confidence interval of mean height of teachers in a small town.,A 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class.,A two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students.,None of the above.,D
Which of the following is the best description of the power of a significance test?,The probability that the null hypothesis is true.,The probability of getting a Type I error.,The probability of getting a Type II error.,"The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is, in fact, false.",D
A drug company will conduct a randomized controlled study on the effectiveness of a new heart disease medication called Heartaid. Heartaid is more expensive than the currently used medication. The analysis will include a significance test with H0: Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease and HA: Heartaid is more effective than the current medication at preventing heart disease. Which of these would be a potential consequence of a Type II error?,"Patients will spend more money on Heartaid, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.","Doctors will begin to prescribe Heartaid to patients, even though it is actually not any more effective than the current medication.","Patients will continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.","Researchers will calculate the wrong P-value, making their advice to doctors invalid.",C
Two classes take the same exam. Suppose a certain score is at the 40th percentile for the first class and at the 80th percentile for the second class. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?,Students in the first class generally scored higher than students in the second class.,Students in the second class generally scored higher than students in the first class.,A score at the 20th percentile for the first class is at the 40th percentile for the second class.,A score at the 50th percentile for the first class is at the 90th percentile for the second class.,A
"The mean thrust of a certain model jet engine is 9500 pounds. Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?",99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350 pounds.,99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.,0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.,There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.,D
"When the point (15,2) is included, the slope of regression line (y= a+ bx) is b= -0.54. The correlation is r= -0.82. When the point is removed, the new slope is -1.04 and the new correlation coefficient is -0.95. What name is given to a point whose removal has this kind of effect on statistical calculations?",Outlier,Statistically significant point,Point of discontinuity,Influential point,D
