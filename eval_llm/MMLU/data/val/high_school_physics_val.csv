An equal number of hydrogen and carbon dioxide molecules are placed in a sealed container. The gases are initially at a temperature of 300 K when the container is placed in an oven and brought to a new equilibrium temperature of 600 K. Which of the following best describes what is happening to the molecular speeds and kinetic energies of the gases’ molecules as they move from 300 K to 600 K?,"The molecules of both gases, on average, end with the speed and the same average kinetic energy.","The molecules of hydrogen, on average, end with a higher speed, but the molecules of both gases end with the same average kinetic energy.","The molecules of hydrogen, on average, speed up more and end with a higher average kinetic energy.","As heat flows into the container, the entropy rises, and it is not possible to determine the average velocity and average kinetic energy of the gases.",B
"A uniform bar is lying on a flat table. Besides the gravitational and normal forces (which cancel), the bar is acted upon by two other forces, F1 and F2, which are parallel to the surface of the table. If the net force on the rod is zero, then which one of the following is true?",The net torque on the bar must also be zero.,The bar can accelerate translationally if F1 and F2 are not applied at the same point.,The net torque will be zero if F1 and F2 are applied at the same point.,The bar cannot accelerate translationally or rotationally.,C
