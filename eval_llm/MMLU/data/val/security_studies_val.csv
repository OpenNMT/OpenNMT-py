Which of these statements best defines social constructivism?,"Social constructivism argues that security can be constructed, and that the human world is not given or natural but instead is a product of human actors.","Social constructivism only studies aspects of the international system that are based in the societal sphere, such as issues of poverty, race relations and gender.","Societal constructivism is concerned with the study of 'natural' systems, hierarchies and values that exist within the international system and which define its societies.",Social constructivism as a concept eludes definition; it is a group of loosely based theories and ideas rather than a specific political or scientific approach.,A
What has been the effect of chemical weapons on international society?,"The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.","The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.","Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.","While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the ""poor mans"" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.",D
Which of the following statements best describes the wider security impacts of disease in terms of achieving security?,"Health security is vital to achieving human security, when considering the individual as the referent object of security studies, fatal or potentially fatal infection directly undermines the attainment of security.","As levels of infection within a population rise, the potential for strategically important groups such as civil servants, judges, and government officials etc to become infected will also rise, thus directly challenging regime security.","Disease within a population threatens security both directly and indirectly, as it affects the health of the individual as well as the ability of that individual to perform vital roles within the wider society.","Health issues, such as the prevalence of infectious disease or the ability of citizens to participate in military service, are not a matter of concern for security analysts.",C
In what ways can the environment be linked to human insecurity?,Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person's or community's capacity to adapt to their surroundings.,The ways in which environmental change can threaten the welfare of the international system is dependent on the extensity of poverty as the key variable determining a population's reactive capability. Environmental change would have a negative impact if resources were available to adapt to environmental change to sustain their existing income levels.,"In terms of the social determinants of insecurity, environmental change does not undermine human security in isolation; larger scale processes affect people's sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity to adapt, whilst past processes shape present insecurities and ongoing processes shape future insecurities.",The concept of environmental human security is an essentially contested concept lacking empirical credibility of the ways in which specific environmental changes affect individuals or communities in particular times/ places and how this alters over a period of time. The lack of an agreed definition on what constitutes human security makes the possibility of developing a framework unlikely.,C
"According to Waltz, how can a state achieve security?","By ensuring they have the power to protect themselves from attack, power that is gained either through internal or external balancing.",Through the accumulation of territory and other material resources needed to physically defend themselves.,By creating an international security environment in which their alliance is fundamentally important to potential aggressors.,Through a combination of military and economic measures that secure the state's position as the leader in a competitive international system.,A
"From a critical perspective, how does postcolonialism relate to security studies?",Postcolonialism highlights the consequences for analysis of Eurocentrism and promises better social scientific explanations by taking into account marginalised points of view.,Postcolonialism identifies the multiple ways in which security studies expresses the point of view of the colonizers and imperialists and asks how and for whom security is defined.,"Postcolonialism holds out the possibility of more plural, enabling and transformative understandings of our world.",All of these options.,D
What is the network form of organization?,Collaboration between individuals is often ad hoc and transitory; networks are formed and disbanded as circumstances warrant.,"Networks have a decentralized, 'flat' organizational form.",The 'network' offers the most efficacious compromise between profit-maximizing and risk-minimizing structural forms.,All of these options.,D
What is the relationship between historical materialism (HM) and discourse?,"As a philosophical approach, HM focuses purely on discourse and as such is distinctive from the other major approaches to international relations.",HM is interested in how changes in particular structures and the inequalities of power associated with them are vital to the rise and fall of discourses.,HM regards discourse between states and government actors to be the most important sphere for analysis within the international system.,"Under the HM paradigm, the realm of political discourse is considered to be of secondary importance to the examination of practical or lived experiences of political interaction.",B
What are the differences between 'greedy state' and 'security seeker' states?,"'Greedy' states are those that seek to advance their power through territorial expansion, even when they are already secure in the status quo. 'Security seeker' states are those that only want to be secure in the status quo, although they might get drawn into arms races and war because of structural pressures in the anarchic international system.","'Greedy states' seek territorial expansion as a result of pressures created by the international system. The anarchic nature of the international system makes states insecure, and greedy states seek to rectify this by any means necessary. 'Security seekers' on the other hand are those already secure in the status quo.","There is no difference, the terms are synonymous.","'Security seeker' states are those interested in achieving security in the international system, whilst 'greedy states' are interested only in amassing power, land, and other resources.",A
Which of the following is not an advantage of cooperation between states?,Potential for arms control and unilateral restraint.,Improvement of political relationships between states.,"To appear cooperative is to appear as a 'security seeker', thus encouraging further cooperation from neighbour states.",Cooperation between states eradicates the propensity for states to cheat on agreements such as arms control or disarmament deals.,D
How can examination of previous state practice and policy be used to justify humanitarian intervention?,"Previous state practice does not illustrate any successful acts of humanitarian intervention, instead indicating that future acts of intervention need to be more closely regulated by international governing bodies.","Every humanitarian crisis since the Cold War has been met with humanitarian intervention as a response from the international society, and as a result countless deaths through genocide avoided.","State practice since the end of the Cold War suggests that there is a customary right of humanitarian intervention, but not of duty, in response to humanitarian emergencies.","Examples of humanitarian intervention, such as intervention during the Rwandan genocide in 1994, illustrate previous policy that supports the claims to a right of humanitarian intervention.",C
"What, according to Classical economic theory, was the purpose of Mercantilism in the 18th century?","Mercantilism was a means by which to strengthen the sovereign state, and inherently linked to international conflict.",Mercantilism was a means by which to promote societal security for the populations of states.,Mercantilism was a route to increasing imports and transnational trade.,Mercantilism was not a significant economic theory until after the 18th century.,A
Which of the following scenarios best represents the type of sanctions common since the end of the Cold War?,Leader A denies normal economic relations with the business associates and family of Leader B.,Leader A denies normal economic relations with the state of Leader B.,"Leader A ends all trade in goods and services with businesses, institutions and markets of Leader B's state.","Leader A ceases normal economic activity with the general domestic market of Leader B's state, but continues select relations with the business and family of Leader B.",A
What can social constructivism offer to the discipline of Security Studies?,The social constructivist perspective has been largely criticised in its failure to be applicable to contemporary conflict situations. The strength of the approach lies in its application to theories of social security.,Social constructivism supports realist theory and provides ontological clarification for some of the questions raised by the traditionalist approach.,The social constructivist perspective offers the possibility of moving beyond the logic of anarchy that underpins the realist approach to security studies.,"Security studies is best approached using a social constructivist perspective, as this will aide the formulation of empirically testable theories and reveal truths about the international system for further investigation.",C
How significant are dealings in illicit arms as part of the global defence trade?,"Although the bulk of defence trade is legal, we know that a certain amount is illicit and involves transfers on the black and grey markets.",The global defence market is too tightly regulated and controlled to allow illicit arms trade to any significant degree.,We do not have enough evidence or knowledge on illegal arms trading to assess whether it takes place on a significant scale.,There is a clear distinction between those weapons that are legally procured and those that are illicitly procured.,A
Which of the following does not characterize the epistemology of traditional security studies?,"Traditional security studies regards the search for empirically testable 'truths' to be detrimental to the pursuit of a practical analytical framework with which to study security, largely due to a recognition in the field that security was not limited to a narrow or easily defined set of 'real' principles.",Knowledge was regarded as subjective and doubts were cast on whether any empirically testable 'truths' or realities could be defined for certain.,"Traditional security studies adopt a positivist approach, based in scientific objectivism that pursues the definition of specific 'truths' that can be empirically tested and validated.","Traditional security studies adopt a subjective approach to knowledge, based on the notion that what constitutes as a 'truth' or as a 'value' cannot be easily distinguished from one another.",C
How should Security Studies be studied?,"An examination of the social processes by which people construct a threat, taking into account the importance of ideational factors such as culture, beliefs, norms, ideas and identity.",Concern about the moral and ethical dimensions of international affairs.,"The separation of fact and value to generate theoretically grounded hypotheses, which can then be tested against evidence.",None of the above.,D
In what ways has the global energy environment affected the security of oil producing states?,"In order to secure the continuation of supplies from oil-rich nations, states in the North have utilised their diplomatic influence to bolster human security, promoting the growth of strong liberal democratic regimes that can operate securely on the free market.","The political and economic spheres remain mutually exclusive from one another and state actors decline to intervene in the commercial aspects of oil production, instead leaving the responsibility to secure resources with international oil companies.","In their attempts to secure the continuation of energy supplies, industrialised states provide military aid to the regimes of oil-rich states, having a vested interest in securing these regimes and thus protecting the status quo, often to the detriment of human security.","Under the prevailing principles of state sovereignty and non-interference, there is limited impact on regime security of oil-producing states as a result of external interests.",C
Which of the following describes the basis of the case in support of humanitarian intervention?,"Associated with liberalism and cosmopolitanism, the foundational idea in support of humanitarian intervention is that external actors have a duty as well as a right to intervene to halt genocide and mass atrocities.",Just War theory and Christian theology can be interpreted to advocate the use of force through humanitarian intervention where the need to allay human suffering justifies such actions.,The case for humanitarian intervention rests on the Kantian philosophy that individuals have fundamental human rights that must be protected.,"Due to the social interconnectedness that is the result of globalisation, and which characterises the contemporary global society, human rights violations in one part of the world will affect every other part in some way.",A
Which of the following is not a motivation for utilising aid as an economic policy for security?,"To reward recipients for the cessation of negative behaviour, such as human rights abuses.",To incentivise recipients to act in ways beneficial to the donor.,Compassion for the human suffering of others.,To influence recipients or potential recipients through granting or denying aid.,C
How prevalent is terrorist activity?,"The distinction between domestic and international attacks has become increasingly widened, particularly the difference between domestic orientated terrorism - such as the removal of a government figure - and externally directed activities where objectives may be ideological.","Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing. International occurrences can be ten times higher in the figures of injuries and deaths, which may be attributable to the larger scale of force employed in terrorist operations. Successive numbers of internationally directed incidents of terrorism in 2002, 2003, and 2004, were higher than those in 2001.","Terrorism is the single gravest threat to international security in the contemporary world, and domestic and international terrorist attacks are responsible for a greater number of deaths in recent years than any form of military, conventional or non-conventional warfare.","The extensity and effect of international terrorism is contentious. Domestic acts of violence continue to be the most prevalent form of terrorism, the predominant difference being that international terrorist acts generate greater media attention.",D
Which of the following best describes the relationship between postcolonialism and security studies?,"Postcolonialism sits outside security studies, as it concerns only the welfare of nations and peoples once subject to imperial power.","Despite some minor differences, postcolonialism shares with traditional security studies its view of the international system and world powers.","Postcolonialism rejects the concept of power that is central to within security studies and rejects the notion that traditionally dominant states, such as the USA, should be considered powerful.",Relations between postcolonialism and security studies are tense and contested. Postcolonialism questions the standard Westphalian account of world history that is the basis of security studies.,D
Is the provision of security policy against terrorism a problematic pursuit?,Although trends suggest that terrorism shows little sign of abating there is some positive indication that international cooperation between countries will play an increasingly important role in collaboration with indigenous intelligence agencies. A meaningful international definition of terrorism would provide a useful framework for responding to the spectre of terrorism.,Responding to terrorism solely in its manifest form (the war on terror and crime approaches) holds little potential for eradicating terrorism in the long-term. It is clear that terrorism will remain a security threat for years to come unless the root causes are addressed. Countermeasures will prove fruitless (or a perpetual fight) unless nascent discontent is addressed before it is radicalized.,All of these options.,"A concern with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential consequences on civil liberties. The greatest danger comes when governments regard the battle against terrorism as warfare because most democratic countries permit greater restrictions on the rights of individuals during wartime. As a consequence, viewing the struggle as 'war' tends to have connotations with the idea that temporary personal curtailment may be a necessity for long-term victory.",C
"As Cold War tensions declined, which three international issues emerged as new interested in the field of peace studies?",Global environmental issues and their potential to limit economic expansion; the economic dependence of newly independent post-colonial states; and the Vietnam war.,"Economic security in the globalised international arena; localised environmental issues that potentially limited industrial expansion; and the Vietnam war, particularly in its capability to act as a drain on military and economic resources of the U.S.A.","Primarily, the potential for a breakdown in détente and the subsequent escalation of Cold War tensions, leading to a focus on maintaining peace and the negotiations between East and West; secondly, a focus on the impacts of the Vietnam war that stems from this concern; and finally, a study of the development of post-colonial states.",The economic prosperity of newly independent post-colonial states; global environmental issues; and the emergence of new security threats in de-escalation of Cold War tensions.,A
"Which of the following was not a noticeable consequence of the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003, in terms of security studies?","Although the ultimate impact of SARS was less severe than many feared, the outbreak served to warn international communities of the potential threat posed by infectious diseases in the globalized arena.","High rates of morbidity amongst infected patients posed a direct threat to human security. With most fatalities occurring within young, otherwise healthy adult populations, serious questions about future economic and other sectors of security were raised.","Quarantine and isolation procedures were implemented by some national health agencies, restricting the movements of those perceived to be at risk of being infected with the virus.","There were detrimental impacts on the travel and tourism industry, as people became reluctant to expose themselves to areas or situations which they deemed to pose a higher risk of infection.",B
Which of the following is the best way to control the international arms trade?,"There is no effective mechanism for controlling the global defence trade, as illustrated by the failures of arms control measures in the 20th and 21st century.","Despite significant challenges, effective arms control of the complex defence trade can be achieved. For this to be possible will require cooperation and compromise between governments and other actors.",A complete ban on weapons and arms trade is the only comprehensive solution to the problems arising from the global arms trade.,Non-governmental rather than state or government agencies are best placed to develop the comprehensive and complex solutions needed to tackle challenges arising from the global defence trade.,B
