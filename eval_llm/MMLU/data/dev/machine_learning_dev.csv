"A 6-sided die is rolled 15 times and the results are: side 1 comes up 0 times; side 2: 1 time; side 3: 2 times; side 4: 3 times; side 5: 4 times; side 6: 5 times. Based on these results, what is the probability of side 3 coming up when using Add-1 Smoothing?",2.0/15,1.0/7,3.0/16,1.0/5,B

"To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?",around 10 examples,around 100 examples,between 100 and 500 examples,more than 1000 examples,D
"Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat’s suggestion:",It is too computationally expensive.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores badly on the training set and a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on the training set but badly on a testset.,It would probably result in a decision tree that scores well on a testset but badly on a training set.,C
