"A list of numbers has n elements, indexed from 1 to n. The following algorithm is intended to display the number of elements in the list that have a value greater than 100. The algorithm uses the variables count and position. Steps 3 and 4 are missing.
 Step 1: Set count to 0 and position to 1.
 Step 2: If the value of the element at index position is greater
 than 100, increase the value of count by 1.
 Step 3: (missing step)
 Step 4: (missing step)
 Step 5: Display the value of count.
 Which of the following could be used to replace steps 3 and 4 so that the algorithm works as intended?","Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.
 Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of count is greater than 100.","Step 3: Increase the value of position by 1.
 Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until t he value of position is greater than n.","Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the value of count is greater than 100.
