Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?,Translation,Conjugation,Specialized transduction,Transformation,A
A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?,By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum,By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell,By changing the shape of the protein,An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.,C
